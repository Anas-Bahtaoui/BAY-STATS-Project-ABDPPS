#n	- The number of samples required.
#adj	- The adjacency matrix corresponding to the graph structure which can be non-decomposable or decomposable. It should be an upper triangular matrix in which a_{ij}=1 if there is a link between notes i and j, otherwise a_{ij}=0. adj could be an object of class "graph", from function graph.sim. It also could be an object of class "sim", from function bdgraph.sim. It also could be an object of class "bdgraph", from functions bdgraph.mpl or bdgraph.
#b	- The degree of freedom for G-Wishart distribution, W_G(b, D).
#D	- The positive definite (p \times p) "scale" matrix for G-Wishart distribution, W_G(b, D). The default is an identity matrix.
#threshold	 -The threshold value for the convergence of sampling algorithm from G-Wishart'.
